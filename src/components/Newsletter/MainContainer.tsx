                            <p>
                            Unlike traditional phishing, spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations. Attackers often gather information from social media or company websites to craft personalized messages that appear legitimate.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            Cybercriminals are increasingly utilizing AI tools to automate phishing campaigns, making them more efficient and harder to detect. These tools can generate convincing emails that mimic trusted sources.

                            Phishing attacks are no longer limited to email. Attackers are now using SMS (smishing), social media platforms, and even voice calls (vishing) to reach potential victims through multiple channels.

                            In early 2024, a major bank fell victim to a sophisticated spear phishing attack that compromised customer data. Attackers impersonated bank representatives and sent emails requesting sensitive information, leading to significant financial losses.

                            <p>
                            A healthcare organization experienced a ransomware attack after employees clicked on a malicious link in an email disguised as a routine update. The attack encrypted critical patient data, causing operational disruptions and reputational damage.
